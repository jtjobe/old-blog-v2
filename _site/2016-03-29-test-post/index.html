<p>If you’re not using case statements, you should be.</p>

<p>David Thomas, author of Programming Ruby, calls the case expression “a powerful beast: a multiway if on steroids”.</p>

<p>In less colorful words: anytime you have a long, messy if/else statement you might want to consider using a case expression instead.</p>

<p>Take the following three code snippets.</p>

<h4 id="messy-ifelse-statement">1) Messy If/Else Statement</h4>

<noscript><pre>sports = %w{ football soccer basketball baseball volleyball }

game = sports.sample

if game == &#39;football&#39;
  puts &quot;touchdown&quot;
elsif game == &#39;soccer&#39;
  puts &quot;goal&quot;
elsif game == &#39;basketball&#39;
  puts &quot;basket&quot;
elsif game == &#39;baseball&#39;
  puts &quot;run&quot;
elsif game == &quot;volleyball&quot;
  puts &quot;point&quot;
end
</pre></noscript>

<h4 id="refactored-with-case-statement">2) Refactored with Case Statement</h4>

<noscript><pre>sports = %w{ football soccer basketball baseball volleyball }

case sports.sample
  when &#39;football&#39;
    puts &quot;touchdown&quot;
  when &#39;soccer&#39;
    puts &quot;goal&quot;
  when &#39;basketball&#39;
    puts &quot;basket&quot;
  when &#39;baseball&#39;
    puts &quot;run&quot;
  when &quot;volleyball&quot;
    puts &quot;point&quot;
end</pre></noscript>

<h4 id="refactored-to-one-line-expressions">3) Refactored to One-Line Expressions</h4>

<noscript><pre>sports = %w{ football soccer basketball baseball volleyball }

case sports.sample
  when &#39;football&#39; then puts &quot;touchdown&quot;
  when &#39;soccer&#39; then puts &quot;goal&quot;
  when &#39;basketball&#39; then puts &quot;basket&quot;
  when &#39;baseball&#39; then puts &quot;run&quot;
  when &quot;volleyball&quot; then puts &quot;point&quot;
end</pre></noscript>

<p>The code above is simple enough that quickly making sense of what’s happening in the multiway if isn’t all that difficult. However, in more complex use cases this same refactoring can be the difference between easy to read self-documenting code and an unclear mess that takes extra time to decipher.</p>
